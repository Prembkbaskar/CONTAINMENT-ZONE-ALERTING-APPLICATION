## Skills Required:
> IBM Cloud,HTML,Javascript,IBM Cloud Object Storage,Python-Flask,Kubernetes,Docker,IBM DB2,IBM Container Registry

## Project Description üìúüìú:
> The application is intended to provide information about the containment zones in a particular region by alerting people, through continuous monitoring of an individual's location through GPS.The key benefits of the application are monitoring people's activity and alerting them when they enter a contaminated zone.


> Developed real-time alert system with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leading to a 40% increase in user engagement.


> Integrated geolocation-based tracking with Flask and JavaScript, resulting in a 50% reduced response time.


>  Utilized IBM Cloud Services and SendGrid for seamless communication, resulting in a 25% improvement in emergency response efficiency and enhanced public safety through timely email information dissemination

   > This application is intended to provide information about containment zones in a particular region by alerting people, through continuous monitoring of an individual's location.  Key benefits of the application are monitoring people's activity and alerting them of their safety movements.

## Features of the Application

- [x] Admin App (portal):

> They should login to the app and update the containment zones locations in the portal.  Based on the location a Geofence will be created within a 100 meters radius.  They should be able to see how many people are visiting that zone.


- [x] User App (Mobile App):

> The app should have a user registration and login.  After the user logged into the app it will  track the user's location and update the database with the current location.  If the user is visiting the containment zone he will get an alert notification.
